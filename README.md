Veto-LiveCoding
===============

A Live Coding Environment for AudioPython, QML and GLSL(also rudimentary Python IDE capabilities) in QT/C++.
Should be platform independent but GLSL is only working in Windows right now; in order to get AudioPython
to work, you will install that as well(naturally). No additional Python packages are required.

Version & General Infos
-----------------------

Package Version:    `0.1.1 Alpha/Test`

Packages used to develop this application(and their versions):

    Qt:     5.1-5.3 (QT 5 is necessary)
    Python: 2.7 (Python 3.x support is experimental and not really working, sorry for that)

Capabilities
------------

As stated above, this repo implements a live coding environment for a few languages in QT.
Supported languages are GLSL(Fragment Shader), AudioPython and QML. Also, it can pose as
a Python interpreter - with very limited features though.

**GLSL**:

GLSL(OpenGL Shading Language) is a programming language to execute code directly on the 
graphics processor. This code is known as shaders. In our environment only so called fragment
shaders can be programmed to make live coding easy and fast, without needing to write heaps of 
code. Those fragment shaders are then rendered in a window which you can adjust to your liking,
e.g. display it fullscreen on a beamer.

NOTE: By now, rendering only works on Windows(we do not know why, but we are looking into it).

**AudioPython**:

[AudioPython](https://github.com/hellerve/AudioPython) is an audio programming library for Python,
which brings basic audio programming capabilities to Python and lets the data generated by the code
be encoded to .wav files live. This is where the fun starts: You only need to code what you would
like to hear(say, a sine wave, a drumbeat or a hammond organ with delay) and the Editor, armed with
AudioPython will do the rest.

NOTE: You need a Python-inclusive build for that. Look [here](#compilation) for further infos on that
matter.

**QML**:

QML(QT Markup Language) is a declarative programming language, based on JSON, by Qt. It is mostly
used for quick UI generation, but can be used and abused, e.g. for multimedia. That is what we did
here.

NOTE: The support for this is a stub and will need a few weeks to work as expected.

**Python (Regular)**:

Since it did not include big effort and we already had the Python interpreter up and running, we 
decided to include a vanilla version as well. It is very basic, though, and does not have the 
capabilites most people want to have in their IDE(Execption tracebacks, interactive command line,
debugger et cetera).
Most of those features are not suited for a live environment and are excluded by will.
You can have fun with the environment, though(well, we know we had).

Compilation
-----------

There is two ways to compile the project: with or without Python support. Per default, Python
is disabled. If you want to keep it that way, just run your normal `qmake`/`make`toolchain.
If you want to enable Python, you will have to provide a few extra arguments and the final
command chain will look like this

```
qmake CONFIG+=with_python QMAKE_CXXFLAGS+=-DWITH_PYTHON
make CPPFLAGS+="-DWITH_PYTHON"
```

You will notice redundance here, this is because the MOC is dumb and we do not know of any
more elegant ways to cope with that.

Anyway, this will enable Python 2.7 support for you. We do not provide any guarantees for 
Python 3.x just yet.

**Additional info:**
Please note that there are actually three ways to compile the project. There is an option
called with_python_custom where you will have to provide any additional config flags yourself.
You can try it out with, e.g.:

```
qmake CONFIG+=with_python_custom QMAKE_CXXFLAGS+=-DWITH_PYTHON \
    QMAKE_CXX_FLAGS+=`/usr/bin/python2.7-config --clfags` \
    QMAKE_LFLAGS+=`/usr/bin/python2.7-config --ldflags`
make CPPFLAGS+="-DWITH_PYTHON"
```

This toolchain will essentially do the same thing that the option ```with_python``` does on Unix.

Usage
-----

If you open the application for the first time, you will be greeted by an empty editor - that
will be your playground.

Default syntax highlighting will be GLSL, but you can tweak the settings to highlight Python
code as well. There are a few minor differences, but generally, We use GLSL highlighting for
Python, as it is good enough for my lazy ass(but we code in Vim, too, so we might not be the
best users for scale).

More coming soon.


Settings
--------

Settings capabilities are important for every IDE. In our editor preferences are set per-tab,
because you might want to code graphics and audio live(if you can pull that off, you are a 
genius!) and if you set them before the session, that will save an enormous amount of time.

The settings window(which can be reached by pressing the little cogwheel button) should
be pretty self-explaining, but we will explain it non-the-less.

In the first tab there are few things you can tweak regarding layout:

**Design**:

There you can adjust the editor design.

**Highlighting**:

There you can change the syntax highlighting(or even switch it off).

**Language**:

At the moment, only english and german are supported. An experimental version
of french is being created, but I do not trust my french very much. Not more than
my spanish and japanese, so all three of them will take a while.

In the second tab you can adjust the editors' behaviour to your liking:

**Startup behaviour**:

In this pane you can adjust the editors behaviour on startup. Most people will keep them
as they are, I guess, but if you want to start everything from scratch every time, you might
toggle all of them.

**Compiler**:

This is the most important part of the settings window. There you are able to change the 
compiler/interpreter that is used for your code.

Contribute
----------

At the time being, most issues are in integrating the interpreters/compilers. We are working
in making OpenGL support platform-independent and the AudioPython interpreter more stable.
QML is up next.

A few bugs are in memory allocation/cleanup routines, but they should be fixed pretty soon;
we are valgrind aficionados, after all.

If you want a interpreter/compiler that's not on the list, feel free to contact us. We
will brief you on how to best approach that and integrate your code as good as possible.
