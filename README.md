Veto-LiveCoding
===============

A Live Coding Environment for AudioPython, QML and GLSL(also rudimentary Python IDE capabilities) in QT/C++.
Should be platform independent but GLSL is only working in Windows right now; in order to get AudioPython
to work, you will install that as well(naturally). No additional Python packages are required.
