<p>A Live Coding Environment for AudioPython, QML and GLSL(also rudimentary Python IDE capabilities) in QT/C++.<br />In order to get AudioPython to work from source, you will have to install QT as well(naturally).<br />No additional Python packages are required. The editor is platform-independent.</p>

<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>As stated above, this repo implements a live coding environment for a few languages in QT.<br />Supported languages are GLSL(Fragment Shader), AudioPython and QML. Also, it can pose as<br />a Python interpreter - with very limited features though.</p>
<p><strong>GLSL</strong>:</p>
<p>GLSL(OpenGL Shading Language) is a programming language to execute code directly on the<br />graphics processor. This code is known as shaders. In our environment only so called fragment<br />shaders can be programmed to make live coding easy and fast, without needing to write heaps of<br />code. Those fragment shaders are then rendered in a window which you can adjust to your liking,<br />e.g. display it fullscreen on a beamer.</p>
<p><strong>AudioPython</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hellerve/AudioPython">AudioPython</a> is an audio programming library for Python,<br />which brings basic audio programming capabilities to Python and lets the data generated by the code<br />be encoded to .wav files live. This is where the fun starts: You only need to code what you would<br />like to hear(say, a sine wave, a drumbeat or a hammond organ with delay) and the Editor, armed with<br />AudioPython will do the rest.</p>
<p>NOTE: You need a Python-inclusive build for that. Look <a href="#compilation">here</a> for further infos on that<br />matter.</p>
<p><strong>QML</strong>:</p>
<p>QML(QT Markup Language) is a declarative programming language, based on JSON, by Qt. It is mostly<br />used for quick UI generation, but can be used and abused, e.g. for multimedia. That is what we did<br />here.</p>
<p>NOTE: The support for this is a stub and will need a few weeks to work as expected so it is<br />disabled right now.</p>
<p><strong>Python (Regular)</strong>:</p>
<p>Since it did not include big effort and we already had the Python interpreter up and running, we<br />decided to include a vanilla version as well. It is very basic, though, and does not have the<br />capabilites most people want to have in their IDE(Execption tracebacks, interactive command line,<br />debugger et cetera).<br />Most of those features are not suited for a live environment and are excluded by will.<br />You can have fun with the environment, though(well, we know we had).</p>
<h2 id="compilation">Compilation</h2>
<p>There is two ways to compile the project: with or without Python support. Per default, Python<br />is disabled. If you want to keep it that way, just run your normal <code>qmake</code>/<code>make</code>toolchain.<br />If you want to enable Python, you will have to provide a few extra arguments and the final<br />command chain will look like this</p>
<pre><code>qmake CONFIG+=with_python QMAKE_CXXFLAGS+=-DWITH_PYTHON
make CPPFLAGS+=&quot;-DWITH_PYTHON&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You will notice redundance here, this is because the MOC is dumb and we do not know of any<br />more elegant ways to cope with that.</p>
<p>Anyway, this will enable Python 2.7 support for you. We do not provide any guarantees for<br />Python 3.x just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info:</strong><br />Please note that there are actually three ways to compile the project. There is an option<br />called with_python_custom where you will have to provide any additional config flags yourself.<br />You can try it out with, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>qmake CONFIG+=with_python_custom QMAKE_CXXFLAGS+=-DWITH_PYTHON \
    QMAKE_CXX_FLAGS+=`/usr/bin/python2.7-config --clfags` \
    QMAKE_LFLAGS+=`/usr/bin/python2.7-config --ldflags`
make CPPFLAGS+=&quot;-DWITH_PYTHON&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This toolchain will essentially do the same thing that the option <code>with_python</code> does on Unix.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>If you open the application for the first time, you will be greeted by an empty editor - that<br />will be your playground.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Documentation/open.png" title="Your playground" alt="Your playground" /></p>
<p>Default syntax highlighting will be GLSL, but you can tweak the settings to highlight Python<br />code as well. There are a few minor differences, but generally, we use GLSL highlighting for<br />Python, as it is good enough for our lazy asses(but we code in Vim, too, so we might not be the<br />best users for scale).</p>
<p><img src="../images/Documentation/glsl.png" title="Highlighting in a nutshell" alt="Highlighting" /></p>
<p>You might want to take a ride and you can(on every platform we know of, provided there is OpenGL<br />and GLSL installed). There are examples for Graphics and Audio Live Coding within the <code>examples</code><br />directory; the audio examples are rather basic, while the graphics files are partially very advanced.<br />The glsl files are mostly from <a href="https://glsl.heroku.com">the glsl playground</a>. Check it out, it's<br />awesome! Some of the sound examples are ported from javascript and the ideas are from<br /><a href="https://wavepot.com">wavepot</a>, check that out as well; we're a bit jealous of both projects, because<br />they are browser-based and hip and all, but we still like to use desktop apps(old-fashioned, huh?).<br />If you open and run them, you can play around with it very well(run it by hitting the systems refresh<br />action(<code>F5</code> on Windows and Linux, <code>Cmd+R</code> on OS X)). If you are doing graphics, a new window<br />will pop open that renders the shader, concerning audio there will be sound playing.<br />Our personal preference is to drag rendering windows to a different screen so you have a clean<br />workbench. If you change something, you can hit refresh at every point in your development and the<br />updated code will be run. If it does not compile, a message will tell you so(either as a popup or<br />as an exception in the bottom part of the editor).</p>
<p><img src="../images/Documentation/glslcompiled.png" title="GLSL example #1" alt="GLSL in action #1" /></p>
<p>If you want to test out the Python capabilities, go to the Settings(for a tutorial on Settings<br />in our environment refer to <a href="#settings">this</a> section) and choose &quot;Python (Regular)&quot; as compiler.<br />Now you can write and interpret Python code, yay!</p>
<p><img src="../images/Documentation/glslcompiled2.png" title="GLSL example #2" alt="GLSL in actioni #2" /></p>
<p>That is not too interesting, though, you might want to use Python in the context of Audio Live<br />Coding, as promised earlier. You can do that, too! Just go back to the Settings and select &quot;Audio<br />Python&quot; in the compiler section. For a general tutorial/introduction to AudioPython, refer to<br /><a href="https://github.com/hellerve/AudioPython">this</a> page.</p>
<p>If you want to play with QML, I have bad news for you, though. This feature is not yet ready. :(</p>
<p>That's it with the basics. Have fun!</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>Settings capabilities are important for every IDE. In our editor preferences are set per-tab,<br />because you might want to code graphics and audio live(if you can pull that off, you are a<br />genius!) and if you set them before the session, that will save an enormous amount of time.</p>
<p>The settings window(which can be reached by pressing the little cogwheel button) should<br />be pretty self-explaining, but we will explain it non-the-less.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Documentation/settings.png" title="The settings window, I" alt="The settings window I" /></p>
<p>In the first tab there are few things you can tweak regarding layout:</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong>:</p>
<p>There you can adjust the editor design. It is based on the styles that are available by<br />default from QT(mostly Windows and Fusion, but on certain platforms also other designs,<br />e.g. Mac or KDE).</p>
<p><strong>Highlighting</strong>:</p>
<p>There you can change the syntax highlighting(or even switch it off).</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong>:</p>
<p>At the moment, only english and german are supported. An experimental version<br />of french is being created, but we do not trust our french very much. Not more than<br />our spanish and japanese, so all three of them will take a while.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Documentation/settings2.png" title="The settings window, II" alt="The settings window II" /></p>
<p>In the second tab you can adjust the editors' behaviour to your liking:</p>
<p><strong>Startup behaviour</strong>:</p>
<p>In this pane you can adjust the editors behaviour on startup. Most people will keep them<br />as they are, I guess, but if you want to start everything from scratch every time, you might<br />toggle all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Compiler</strong>:</p>
<p>This is the most important part of the settings window. There you are able to change the<br />compiler/interpreter that is used for your code.</p>
<h2 id="examples-resources">Examples &amp; Resources</h2>
<p>Coming soon.</p>
<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
<p>At the time being, most issues are in integrating the interpreters/compilers. We are working<br />on making the AudioPython interpreter more stable. QML is up next.</p>
<p>A few bugs are in memory allocation/cleanup routines, but they should be fixed pretty soon;<br />we are valgrind fans, after all.</p>
<p>If you want a interpreter/compiler that's not on the list, feel free to contact us. We<br />will brief you on how to best approach that and integrate your code as good as possible.</p>
